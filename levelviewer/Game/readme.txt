This is the "Game" project. This is an experimental attempt to recreate the GK3 engine. It may or may not ever be completed.

The general idea is to create a perfect replica of the original engine that can run on hardware similar to what the original game was capable of using (eg: Pentium III CPU, Geforce graphics card, etc). Then a branch of this project can add new modern features that take advantage of newer hardware and bring the game up to date.

Here's a list of things that need to happen to actually create a GK3 engine recreation:

* Figure out static model format
* Figure out animated model format
* Figure out animation system (animation file format, etc)
* Implement all the Sheep functions
* Complete the Sheep VM to support the "wait" stuff
* And much, much more!
