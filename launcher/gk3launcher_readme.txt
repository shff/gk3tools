GK3 Launcher
v 0.1.0.0
------------

The GK3 Launcher lets you easily run Gabriel Knight 3 in resolutions other than the default 640x480, 800x600, and 1024x768.

== Installation ==
Just copy Gk3Launcher.exe into the same directory with GK3.exe (probably C:\Sierra\Gabriel Knight 3\).

== FAQ ==
Q) I get an error message that says "Unable to launch GK3: The system cannot find the file specified."
A) That means that the launcher couldn't find GK3.exe. Make sure Gk3Launcher.exe is in the same folder as GK3.exe, and you are running it from that directory too.

Q) I want to run in windowed mode, but I get a message that says "Sorry, this program requires support for 16-bit color mode."
A) You probably have your desktop color set to 32-bit. To run GK3 in windowed mode you need to set it to 16-bit color. (This is a GK3 limitation.)

Q) I ran the launcher and picked some wild and crazy resolution that I didn't like, and when I tried to run GK3 normally it was still using that wild and crazy resolution!
A) GK3 remembers the last resolution it used and will keep using it until it is changed again. Just run the launcher again and pick something you like better.

Q) What about the GK3 demo? Does this launcher work with it?
A) Yep!

Q) Is this app really necessary? Couldn't I just set the resolution from the command line or registry or whatever?
A) You could, but don't you think this is a bit easier? 

Q) What's that in the Source directory?
A) That's the source of the GK3 Launcher. You are free to look at it, change it, recompile it, and even redistribute it (under the terms of the GNU GPL).

Q) I have some other question.
A) Then visit http://sourceforge.net/projects/gk3tools/support and ask!
